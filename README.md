The absolute most basic example of AlphaZero and Monte Carlo Tree Search I could come up with. This implementation plays a game called Connect2:

In Connect2 players alternate between playing pieces on a tiny 1x4 board with the goal of placing two of their pieces side-by-side. Itâ€™s comically easy to win as the first player, but Connect2 still has the interesting property that either player technically has the chance to win, lose or draw.
